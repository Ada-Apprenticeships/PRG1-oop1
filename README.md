# PRG1 Object Oriented Programming

### Basic Prediction Questions:
1. **What will be printed when we run `print(steve.talk())`?**

2. **What do you think will be displayed when we execute `print(f"Name: {steve.name}")`?**

3. **If we run the line `steve.name = "Stephen Rich"`, what will happen to the `steve` object?**

### Object Creation Prediction:
4. **After creating `aqil = Person("Aqil Hussain", "01/01/2000", "Manchester")`, predict what `aqil.place_of_birth` will contain.**

5. **If we add this line: `print(aqil.talk())`, what message do you expect to see?**

### Attribute Access Prediction:
6. **What will happen if we try to run `print(steve.date_of_birth)` right after creating the steve object?**

7. **Predict the output if we execute both of these lines in sequence:**
```python
   print(f"Before: {steve.name}")
   steve.name = "Stephen Rich"
   print(f"After: {steve.name}")
```

### Analytical Prediction:

8. **What do you think will happen if we try to access an attribute that doesn't exist, like `print(steve.age)`?**

9. **If we create a third person: `amina = Person("Amina Smith", "15/03/1995", "Birmingham")`, predict what `amina.talk()` will return.**

10. **Looking at the class structure, predict which attributes of a Person object can be changed after it's created, and explain your reasoning.**
